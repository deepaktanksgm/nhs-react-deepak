# 🚀 Setup Instructions - NHS AI Assistant

## What Was Fixed

The original project had **Tailwind CSS configuration issues** that prevented proper styling. Here's what was resolved:

### Issues Found:
1. ❌ Missing `@tailwindcss/vite` package (critical for Tailwind CSS v4)
2. ❌ Incorrect PostCSS configuration
3. ❌ React-day-picker version incompatibility with React 19
4. ❌ Tailwind CSS not being processed by Vite

### Fixes Applied:
1. ✅ Added `@tailwindcss/vite` package to dependencies
2. ✅ Updated `vite.config.js` to include Tailwind plugin
3. ✅ Updated react-day-picker to version 9.8.1 (React 19 compatible)
4. ✅ Restored original Tailwind CSS v4 configuration in `App.css`
5. ✅ Removed incorrect PostCSS and Tailwind config files

## 📋 Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
node --version

# Install pnpm globally (recommended)
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 2. Project Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd NHS-copilot-webapp-fixed

# Install all dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### 3. Verify Installation
- Open browser to `http://localhost:5173/`
- You should see a properly styled NHS-branded page
- Test both buttons to ensure functionality

## 🔧 Key Dependencies Explanation

### Critical Dependencies:
```json
{
  "@tailwindcss/vite": "^4.1.11",    // ESSENTIAL for Tailwind CSS v4
  "tailwindcss": "^4.1.7",          // Tailwind CSS framework
  "react": "^19.1.0",               // Latest React
  "react-day-picker": "9.8.1",      // Updated for React 19 compatibility
  "vite": "^6.3.5"                  // Build tool
}
```

### Why These Versions Matter:
- **@tailwindcss/vite**: Required for Tailwind CSS v4 to work with Vite
- **react-day-picker 9.8.1**: Compatible with React 19 (8.10.1 was not)
- **Tailwind CSS 4.1.7**: Uses new syntax with `@import "tailwindcss"`

## 🎯 Configuration Files

### vite.config.js
```javascript
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'  // Critical import

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],  // Tailwind plugin added
  // ... rest of config
})
```

### App.css
```css
@import "tailwindcss";  // Tailwind CSS v4 syntax
@import "tw-animate-css";

@theme inline {
  /* Custom theme configuration */
}
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Page renders without styling
**Solution**: Ensure `@tailwindcss/vite` is installed and added to vite.config.js

### Issue: Peer dependency warnings
**Solution**: Use `pnpm install` instead of npm (better peer dependency handling)

### Issue: Build fails
**Solution**: Check Node.js version is 18+ and all dependencies are installed
